A three-dimensional modification of the continuum elasticity theory was proposed and an optimal thickness was determined to be 3.8 {ML}. {HRXRD}-determined in-plane strain in superlattices with this range of {GaP} thickness gave an empirical value for the {GaP} thickness to be 4.5 {ML}. Optical characterization indicated the highest integrated {PL} intensity for the sample at the optimal strain balanced condition.},

Based on a review of the existing literature, complete and consistent parameter sets are given for all materials. Emphasizing the quantities required for band structure calculations, we tabulate the direct and indirect energy gaps, spin-orbit, and crystal-field splittings, alloy bowing parameters, effective masses for electrons, heavy, light, and split-off holes, Luttinger parameters, interband momentum matrix elements, and deformation potentials, including temperature and alloy-composition dependences where available. Heterostructure band offsets are also given, on an absolute scale that allows any material to be aligned relative to any other. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the concept of strain balance in alternate tensile and compressively strained layers using classical elasticity theory and clarifies a number of issues associated with the definition of strain and misfit. The strain-balance criteria are derived from a zero average in-plane stress condition and compared against two commonly used thickness weighted models, based on strain and lattice parameter respectively. The zero-stress condition fully accounts for differences in the elastic properties of the layers, and establishes the true definition for a strain-balanced structure, within the confines of linear elastic theory. The validity of the thickness weighted models is discussed in the context of epitaxial growth tolerance, showing that for some device designs, the choice of strain-balance model is important for successful growth. The differences in the strain-balance models have consequences for characterization. For example, a comparison between simulated X-ray rocking curves from structures based on the zero-stress and thickness weighted lattice parameter shows that the coincidence of the zero-order satellite with the substrate Bragg peak does not correspond to the zero-stress situation, but approximates to the average lattice parameter method. The correct identification of a precisely strain-balanced structure requires agreement between experimentally measured and simulated X-ray rocking curves.},

The material parameters considered are: the lattice constant, the lowest direct- and indirect-gap energies, and the refractive index. The model used is based on an interpolation scheme, and the effects of compositional variations are properly taken into account in the calculations.

	abstract = {Using atomic force microscopy ({AFM}), we have directly observed the progression of surface morphology of {InAs} deposited by molecular-beam epitaxy on {GaAs}(100). {InAs} self-assembled dots (coherent) or relaxed {InAs} islands (incoherent) are formed depending on the {InAs} coverage. The {InAs} coverage was varied continuously and {AFM} was used to monitor in detail the nucleation and resulting size and shape transition of the {InAs} self-assembled dots. Dots of uniform size were observed only at the initial stages of this Stranski-Krastanow growth-mode transition. The self-assembled dot density increased very abruptly with total deposited amount of {InAs}. Treating this {InAs} growth-mode transition as a first-order phase transition with {InAs} total coverage as the critical parameter, we extract a critical thickness for surface elastic relaxation of 1.50 {ML}.},
